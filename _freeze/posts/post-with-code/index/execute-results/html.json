These tasks require precision and clarity, which can be achieved effectively using LaTeX. While Jupyter notebooks and RMarkdown are common tools for lab work, knowing how to incorporate LaTeX into these platforms ensures that equations and formulas are presented professionally. Additionally, creating a polished cheatsheet for exams or assignments often involves using LaTeX in Overleaf, a cloud-based LaTeX editor.\n\nLaTeX is a powerful typesetting system designed for technical and scientific documents. It provides a consistent way to format complex mathematical expressions and structures that are difficult to achieve in standard word processors. Learning the basics of LaTeX not only enhances your ability to create high-quality documents but also prepares you to handle various formatting challenges in your academic and professional career.\n\nThis tutorial is structured to first introduce the basics of LaTeX, covering essential concepts such as document structure, writing math equations, and formatting. Following that, it will guide you on using Overleaf, a user-friendly platform for creating and collaborating on LaTeX documents, with an example cheatsheet template to get you started.\n\n### Learning Outcomes\n\nBy the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:  \n\t1.\tUnderstand the basic structure and key components of a LaTeX document.  \n\t2.\tWrite and render mathematical equations and expressions in Jupyter Notebook and RMarkdown.  \n\t3.\tCreate structured, multi-column cheatsheets using Overleaf.  \n\t4.\tApply formatting techniques to improve the readability and organization of LaTeX documents.  \n\t5.\tUtilize LaTeX packages such as amsmath and multicol to enhance functionality and layout.\n\n---\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nThis tutorial assumes that readers have followed the MDS stack software installation instructions available [here](https://ubc-mds.github.io/resources_pages/installation_instructions/) to install JupyterLab, R, and LaTeX. Additionally, it assumes that readers have basic knowledge of using JupyterLab and R. These tools and skills are essential for completing the tasks outlined in this guide.\n\nAdditionally, for each new Conda environment, to ensure that the webpdf export of Jupyter notebooks works successfully, you must run the following commands **before activating the environment**:\n\n```bash\npip install \"nbconvert[webpdf]\"\nplaywright install chromium\n```\n\nThese steps will ensure that your environment is properly configured for exporting Jupyter notebooks as web-ready PDFs.\n\n---\n\n## Writing Math Equations in Jupyter Notebook and RMarkdown\n\nJupyter Notebook and RMarkdown both support LaTeX for rendering math equations. In Jupyter Notebook, the LaTeX code works directly in Markdown cells, while in RMarkdown, it can be included in text sections or inline with code chunks.\n\nHere are the common ways to include equations:\n\n- **Inline Math**: Use single dollar signs `$ ... $` for inline equations.\n  Example: `The equation $y = mx + c$ represents a straight line.`\n\n- **Display Math**: Use double dollar signs `$$ ... $$` or `\\[ ... \\]` for display equations.\n  Example:\n  ```latex\n  $$\n  E = mc^2\n  $$\n  ```\n  Rendered: \n  $$\n  E = mc^2\n  $$\n\n- **Code and Equations**: In RMarkdown, combine R code and LaTeX output in code chunks using `knitr`.\n  Example:\n\n\n  ::: {.cell}\n  \n  ```{.r .cell-code}\n  x <- 1:10\n  plot(x, x^2, main = \"$y = x^2$\")\n  ```\n  \n  ::: {.cell-output-display}\n  ![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n  :::\n  :::\n\n\n\n\nWhether you're using Jupyter Notebook or RMarkdown, these methods ensure your equations are rendered cleanly and professionally.\n\n---\n\n## Common LaTeX Math Commands and Examples\n\n### Math Mode\n- **Subscript and Superscript**:\n  - Subscript: `$a_n$` Rendered: $a_n$\n  - Superscript: `$x^2$` Rendered: $x^2$\n  - For multi-character exponents or indices, use curly brackets: `$x^{10}$, $a_{ijk}$` Rendered: $x^{10}$, $a_{ijk}$\n\n- **Inline Math**: `$E = mc^2$`\n  Rendered: $E = mc^2$\n- **Display Math**:\n  ```latex\n  $$\n  E = mc^2\n  $$\n  ```\n  Rendered: \n  $$\n  E = mc^2\n  $$\n- **Equation with Number**:\n  ```latex\n  \\begin{equation}\n  x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n  \\end{equation}\n  ```\n  Rendered:\n  \\begin{equation}\n  x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n  \\end{equation}\n- **Align Equations**:\n  ```latex\n  \\begin{align}\n  a &= b + c \\\\\n  d &= e + f\n  \\end{align}\n  ```\n  Rendered:\n  \\begin{align}\n  a &= b + c \\\\\n  d &= e + f\n  \\end{align}\n\n### Matrices\n- **Matrix in Brackets**:\n  ```latex\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  a & b \\\\\n  c & d\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  ```\n  Rendered:\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  a & b \\\\\n  c & d\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n- **Matrix in Parentheses**:\n  ```latex\n  \\begin{pmatrix}\n  a & b \\\\\n  c & d\n  \\end{pmatrix}\n  ```\n  Rendered:\n  \\begin{pmatrix}\n  a & b \\\\\n  c & d\n  \\end{pmatrix}\n- **Augmented Matrix**:\n  ```latex\n  \\begin{array}{cc|c}\n  1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n  4 & 5 & 6\n  \\end{array}\n  ```\n  Rendered:\n  \\begin{array}{cc|c}\n  1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n  4 & 5 & 6\n  \\end{array}\n\n### Fractions, Exponents, and Roots\n- **Fractions**: `$\\frac{a}{b}$`\n  Rendered: $\\frac{a}{b}$\n- **Exponents and Subscripts**: `$x^2, a_n$`\n  Rendered: $x^2, a_n$\n- **Square Root**: `$\\sqrt{a}$`\n  Rendered: $\\sqrt{a}$\n- **nth Root**: `$\\sqrt[n]{a}$`\n  Rendered: $\\sqrt[n]{a}$\n\n### Summation, Products, Limits, and Integrals\n- **Summation**: `$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^2}$`\n  Rendered: $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^2}$\n- **Product**: `$\\prod_{i=1}^{n} i$`\n  Rendered: $\\prod_{i=1}^{n} i$\n- **Limits**: `$\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x)$`\n  Rendered: $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x)$\n- **Integral**: `$\\int_{a}^{b} x^2 \\, dx$`\n  Rendered: $\\int_{a}^{b} x^2 \\, dx$\n\n### Greek Letters\n- **Lowercase**: `\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, \\delta, \\epsilon`\n  Rendered: $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, \\delta, \\epsilon$\n- **Uppercase**: `\\Gamma, \\Delta, \\Theta, \\Lambda, \\Pi`\n  Rendered: $\\Gamma, \\Delta, \\Theta, \\Lambda, \\Pi$\n\n### Common Functions\n- **Trigonometric**: `$\\sin(x), \\cos(x), \\tan(x)$`\n  Rendered: $\\sin(x), \\cos(x), \\tan(x)$\n- **Logarithmic**: `$\\log(x), \\ln(x)$`\n  Rendered: $\\log(x), \\ln(x)$\n- **Exponential**: `$e^x$`\n  Rendered: $e^x$\n\n### Operators and Symbols\n- **Arithmetic**: `$a \\pm b, a \\cdot b, a \\div b$`\n  Rendered: $a \\pm b, a \\cdot b, a \\div b$\n- **Logical**: `$\\land, \\lor, \\neg$`\n  Rendered: $\\land, \\lor, \\neg$\n- **Derivatives**: `$\\frac{dy}{dx}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}$`\n  Rendered: $\\frac{dy}{dx}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}$\n\n### Cases and Conditions\n- **Cases**:\n  ```latex\n  \\begin{cases}\n  x^2 & \\text{if } x > 0 \\\\\n  -x^2 & \\text{if } x \\leq 0\n  \\end{cases}\n  ```\n  Rendered:\n  \\begin{cases}\n  x^2 & \\text{if } x > 0 \\\\\n  -x^2 & \\text{if } x \\leq 0\n  \\end{cases}\n\n---\n\n## What is Overleaf?\n\nOverleaf is an online LaTeX editor that simplifies the process of creating, collaborating, and sharing LaTeX documents.
