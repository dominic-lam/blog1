    "text": "Introduction\nFrom time to time, students in the MDS program need to write math equations for their labs and cheatsheets. These tasks require precision and clarity, which can be achieved effectively using LaTeX. Since MDS students come from diverse academic and professional backgrounds, not everyone may have experience using LaTeX to typeset math equations. This tutorial aims to bridge that gap by providing a practical guide with all the necessary information to get started. While Jupyter notebooks and RMarkdown are common tools for lab work, knowing how to incorporate LaTeX into these platforms ensures that equations and formulas are presented professionally. Additionally, creating a polished cheatsheet for exams or assignments often involves using LaTeX in Overleaf, a cloud-based LaTeX editor.\nLaTeX is a powerful typesetting system designed for technical and scientific documents. It provides a consistent way to format complex mathematical expressions and structures that are difficult to achieve in standard word processors. Learning the basics of LaTeX not only enhances your ability to create high-quality documents but also prepares you to handle various formatting challenges in your academic and professional career.\nThis tutorial is structured to first introduce the basics of LaTeX, covering essential concepts such as document structure, writing math equations, and formatting. Following that, it will guide you on using Overleaf, a user-friendly platform for creating and collaborating on LaTeX documents, with an example cheatsheet template to get you started.\n\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:\n1. Understand the basic structure and key components of a LaTeX document.\n2. Write and render mathematical equations and expressions in Jupyter Notebook and RMarkdown.\n3. Create structured, multi-column cheatsheets using Overleaf.\n4. Apply formatting techniques to improve the readability and organization of LaTeX documents.\n5. Utilize LaTeX packages such as amsmath and multicol to enhance functionality and layout."

In Jupyter Notebook, the LaTeX code works directly in Markdown cells, while in RMarkdown, it can be included in text sections or inline with code chunks.\nHere are the common ways to include equations:\n\nInline Math: Use single dollar signs $ ... $ for inline equations. Example: The equation $y = mx + c$ represents a straight line.\nDisplay Math: Use double dollar signs $$ ... $$ or \\[ ... \\] for display equations. Example:\n$$\nE = mc^2\n$$\nRendered: \\[\nE = mc^2\n\\]\n\nWhether you’re using Jupyter Notebook or RMarkdown, these methods ensure your equations are rendered cleanly and professionally."

    "text": "Using Under Bracket and Over Bracket in LaTeX\nIn LaTeX, you can use under brackets and over brackets to annotate or group parts of mathematical expressions. These are particularly useful in making your equations more readable and providing additional context.\n\n1. Over Bracket\nThe \\overbracket command is used to place a bracket above an expression. You can also add annotations above the bracket using the optional argument.\n\nSyntax:\n\\overbracket{expression}^{annotation}\n\n\nExample:\n$$overbracket{a + b + c}^{\\text{Sum of terms}}$$\nThis will produce:\n\\[\n\\overbracket{a + b + c}^{\\text{Sum of terms}}\n\\]\n\n\n\n2. Under Bracket\nThe \\underbracket command is used to place a bracket below an expression. Similar to \\overbracket, you can add annotations below the bracket using the optional argument.\n\nSyntax:\n\\underbracket{expression}_{annotation}\n\n\nExample:\n$$\\underbracket{x + y + z}_{\\text{Group of variables}}$$\nThis will produce:\n\\[\n\\underbracket{x + y + z}_{\\text{Group of variables}}\n\\]\n\n\n\n3. Combining Over and Under Brackets\nYou can use both over and under brackets together to highlight different aspects of the same expression.\n\nExample:\n$$\\overbracket{\\underbracket{a + b}_\\text{Lower group} + c}^{\\text{Upper group}}$$\nThis will produce:\n\\[\n\\overbracket{\\underbracket{a + b}_\\text{Lower group} + c}^{\\text{Upper group}}\n\\]\n\n\n\n4. Use Cases\n\nHighlighting grouped terms in equations.\nAnnotating specific parts of an expression for educational purposes.\nStructuring complex mathematical derivations.\n\n\n\n5. Tips\n\nUse \\text{} for annotations to ensure proper formatting of text in math mode.\nAdjust the size of brackets if needed by using commands like \\big, \\Big, \\bigg, or \\Bigg before the bracket.\n\n\nExample:\n\\[\\Bigg(\\overbracket{a + b}^{\\text{Top annotation}}\\Bigg)\\]\n\\[\\Bigg(\\overbracket{a + b}^{\\text{Top annotation}}\\Bigg)\\]"

You can change this number to adjust the layout (e.g., {3} for three columns).\n\n\\section*{Course Title}\n• Creates a section title without numbering. The * removes the automatic section numbering.\n• Replace “Course Title” with the desired heading for your cheatsheet.\n\\subsection*{subsection} • Similar to \\section*, but creates a smaller, unnumbered subsection title.\n• Useful for organizing content under a specific section. \\hrule % Horizontal Separator\n• Inserts a horizontal line across the page.\n• Often used for visually separating sections or blocks of content.\n\nAdding Expressions or Equations\n• To include LaTeX expressions or equations, wrap the code with:\n$$ ... $$ for display math, or wrap the code with $ ... $ for inline math.\n\n\nUnderstanding Content Layout in Overleaf\nWhen using the multicols environment with a landscape document orientation, the content is distributed across columns horizontally. This means the text fills the columns from top to bottom, moving horizontally across the page to the next column once one is filled. If the content is insufficient to fill all the columns, the remaining space will appear empty vertically within each column.\n\n\n\nExample of content layout with insufficient text, leaving empty vertical space in columns.\n\n\nIn a cheatsheet, this behavior is intentional, as it ensures compact and organized presentation of information across multiple columns. To maximize the vertical utilization of the page:\n1. Increase the amount of content within each column (e.g., adding more sections or equations).\n2. Adjust the number of columns in the \\begin{multicols}{n} command to fit the amount of content better (e.g., reduce n from 6 to 4 if there is less information).\nAs long as there is enough content, the page will be rendered normally, filling both horizontally and vertically as intended.\n\n\n\nExample of content layout with sufficient text, filling columns both vertically and horizontally."
